## 🛸 Story

  The universe has fallen into darkness. Mysterious alien forces have stolen the light, leaving behind a cold, lifeless void.
But hope is not lost...

  You are the last scientist — and humanity's final chance. Armed with your own source of light, you must navigate the depths of your spaceship, room by room, solving complex puzzles and overcoming deadly traps. Your mission: place the light core at the heart of the ship and restore energy to the universe.

  ### ⚠️ Be warned: Without light, there is no life. No energy. No future.
Let the darkness win — and we vanish forever.

  ### 🔦 Remember: Light gives life. Light gives power.
Bring back the light… before it’s too late.
